        <h1>Full Stack Specialization</h1>
        <p>
        Students learn to translate user requirements into the overall 
       software architecture and implement the new solution as web or mobile 
       applications,using cutting-edge frameworks, state-of-the-art toolsets on 
       cloud and enterprise technologies.Themes and styles also help keep your document 
       coordinated. When you click Design and choose a new Theme, the pictures, charts, and 
       SmartArt graphics change to match your new theme. When you apply styles, your headings change 
       to match the new theme.
        </p>
        <h2>Full-Stack Professional</h2>
        <p>
        As a Full-Stack Professional, he or she is expected to work on 
       both Front End & Back End Development, and applying DevOps skills to deploy 
       workloads through Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) 
       pipeline.He or she should have a genuine interest in all software 
       technologies.To make your document look professionally produced, Word provides header, footer, cover 
       page, and text box designs that complement each other. For example, you can add a matching cover page, 
       header, and sidebar. Click Insert and then choose the elements you want from the different galleries.
        </p>
        <h3>Program Structure</h3>
        <p>
        The program is designed as a four-year undergraduate degree.
        The first year is broadly a foundation year comprising modules 
       that will be built upon it in the subsequent years.Reading is easier, too, in the new Reading view. 
       You can collapse parts of the document and focus on the text you want. If you need to stop reading before 
       you reach the end, Word remembers where you left off - even on another device.
